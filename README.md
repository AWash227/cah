#### Contributing and Forking
Right now, I am not accepting pull requests on this project. Feel free to fork the project if you'd like, but only for personal use. 
The idea of having it be open source is so newcomers can see what goes into a project like this. Basically, please don't try to make money off of this
or claim it as your own.
